    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>What does this mean?</h3>
    <p>The amount of meows (cat meows) on your Discord message has increased by 1.</p>
    <h3>Why did you do this?</h3>
    <p>There are several reasons I may deem a message to be worthy of cat meowing. These include, but are not limited to: Rudeness towards other cats, spreading incorrect information, sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s....</p>
    <h3>Am I in your no-friends list?</h3>
    <p>No - not yet. But you should refrain from sending messages like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional meowing, which may put your friendship privileges in jeopardy.</p>
    <h3>How can I prevent this from happening in the future?</h3>
    <p>Accept the meow and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Discord.com. I will continue to issue meows until you improve your conduct. Remember: Discord is privilege, not a right.</p>
