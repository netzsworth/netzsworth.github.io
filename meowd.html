    I just meowed your message.

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>What does this mean?</h2>
The amount of meows (cat meows) on your Discord message has increased by 1.

<h2>Why did you do this?</h2>
There are several reasons I may deem a message to be worthy of cat meowing. These include, but are not limited to:
Rudeness towards other cats, spreading incorrect information, sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s....

<h2>Am I in your no-friends list?</h2>
No - not yet. But you should refrain from sending messages like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional meowing, which may put your friendship privileges in jeopardy.

<h2>How can I prevent this from happening in the future?</h2>
Accept the meow and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Discord.com. I will continue to issue meows until you improve your conduct. Remember: Discord is privilege, not a right.
